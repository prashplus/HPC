# HPC

This repository refers to my BTech 6th Sem project carried out at Charusat under Prof. Dr Ritesh Patel.

The project aims at testing Microsoft HPC Pack 2012 and 2016 by creating cluster of 1 Master and 2 Slave nodes with a SOA service of prime factorization to demonstrate the working of the cluster.

## Getting Started

I might not be able to give you all the steps but mail me if you have any query.
Just setup the Visual Studio 2015 or above and open the project. Make your changes like changing the name of the master node and you are ready to go. Read the readme text file for its setup with the HPC cluster.

### Prerequisites

Microsoft HPC Pack 2012 or higher installed on at least one node (Master). Since, the code is based on the Microsoft MPI. So, you might have to download the Microsoft HPC toolkit to setup the prerequisites of the Microsoft MPI on the Development node and Cluster node.
For hosting I would suggest to go for Windows server 2012 R2 or 2016.

### Setup

Read the readme.txt inside the directory.
